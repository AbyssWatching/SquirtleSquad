Welcome to the Pokecha fullstack repo!

This application was built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js and has JWT Auth implemented
All the data fetched comes from PokeAPI so go check them out for any projects here https://pokeapi.co

This application is still in Alpha but a working build is deployed with Render (https://dashboard.render.com) and is available here https://pokecha.onrender.com/

Pokecha aims to bring entertainment to long time Pokemon fans but also cater to newcomers as well! Roll the button and see what kind of Pokemon you'll get. Then share your earnings with your friends or even educate yourself on your new Pokemon by clicking on their picture for more information.

This application makes use of React Context and React Hooks to handle user and collection state.

Features to implement include:
An audio player
An actual description view for the Pokemon instead of using bulbapedia for a redirect
Responsiveness
And a more interactive experience overall
